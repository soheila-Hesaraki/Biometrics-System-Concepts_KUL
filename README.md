🔍 These are the projects that I have done for biometric systems. A cool course that presents the different aspects of common biometric systems from a technical and practical point of view. 😎

- 🔐 Acquisition: 📸
- 🔎 Feature Extraction: 🔬
- 🔁 Feature Matching: 🔄
- 🤔 Decision Making (Authentication, Identification): 🕵️‍♀️🔍
- 💼 Applications: 🏢👥
- ⚙️ System Performance, Acceptability: 👍📈
- 🔬 More traditional biometric systems (fingerprints, faces, voices, ...) 📚👀

📝 There are three mini-projects:

- Assignment1: The assignment is about validating biometric systems in verification and identification settings. For the experiments, you will make use of actual fingerprint similarity scores of the left and right index fingers. 👆👉✋

- Assignment2: In this second assignment, you will use key-point based features from fingerprint and iris images to match them with a subject in a larger dataset in an identification scenario. The experiments consist of key-point based local and global feature extraction from sample images, the calculation of the similarity score against each image in the dataset, the choice of the similarity threshold to decide a match, and the fusion of fingerprint and iris systems on the score level. 👁️🔑🔢🔍🎯🔐

- Assignment3: In this assignment, you will implement and evaluate a face recognition system. 👤👁️🔍

Hope you enjoy these exciting projects! Good luck! 🍀😄
